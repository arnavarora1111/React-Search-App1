# React Search App

This is a single page app that creates a 3 X 3 matrix of 7 pictures 
and 2 videos according to the topic entered by the user in the Search Box 
located at the top of the screen. The user must press enter after 
typing in the keyword. The user can click on any of the items 
in the matrix to save the URL corresponding to the item selected. This will 
be downloaded on the computer as a .json file and the user can access any of 
the URLs selected at a later time. The 2 YouTube videos can be played by 
clicking on the item and scrolling to the top of the screen. The Third party 
APIs used for the creation of this app include the Unsplash Image API and 
YouTube Data API.
